`git clone` this repository and you will gain access to:
  * **a bootstrap process of a developer machine based around GNU and Homebrew**
    * <a name="cross-platform"></a> cross-platform. No more worries about this is how it works on a developer machine (e.g. MacOS/Windows) and this is how it works in the CI (Linux). **Everything works the same everywhere!**
      * Apple MacOS
      * Linux (Alpine)
      * Linux (Debian)
      * Linux (Ubuntu)
      * Microsoft Windows (WSL)
      * [potentially more if you request/contribute it](https://github.com/rokmoln/support-firecloud/issues/new/choose)
    * brings common GNU utilities (bash, make, grep, sed, find, etc), version locked. No more worries about different flags, different behaviour or missing features!
    * brings [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). No more worries about different versions available in distros' repositositories, or libraries/utilities not being available at all.
  * **sane per-user configuration** (e.g. git)
  * **various utility scripts**, most of them written in pure bash making them easy to read through, easy to run
  * **documentation of common tasks** like bootstrapping, create github repositories, managing secrets, etc
