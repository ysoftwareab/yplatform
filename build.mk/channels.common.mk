# This is a collection of "must have" targets for repositories with (release) channels,
# like desktop apps.
#
# "Channels" is a convention that states that releases (artifacts and/or metadata)
# are published externally to another git repository than the current one.
# This allows for the current repository, holding the codebase, to remain private
# and/or for the "releases" repository to hold an entirely different content (e.g. metadata)
# than the current repository.
# In other words, the "releases" repository needs to be public and make metadata
# accessible for update queries. The current repository doesn't need to do any of those.
#
# This is best described by an Electron app example hosted by github.com,
# where the app binaries can be assets in Github releases,
# and the metadata can be committed as JSON files in different branches,
# where each branch corresponds to a release channel e.g. stable, beta, canary, etc.
# Example: https://github.com/tobiipro/merlin-controller-electron-releases
#
# The "channels" convention is quite different
# than the "environments" convention implemented by env.common.mk
# which states that the current git repository holds both the codebase and the releases.
#
# The "releases" repository will be cloned locally,
# and promoting a tag to a channel is basically pushing a tag to a branch,
# basically updating the channel's metadata to point to new binaries.
# At this point, the desktop app will be able to discover the new metadata on the upcoming poll,
# and possibly present the user to update their version to the latest one.
